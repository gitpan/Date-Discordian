Revision history for Perl extension Date::Discordian.

0.01  Prickle Prickle (Zaraday), Bureaucracy 5 YOLD 3166, 10:37pm
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

1.00  Prickle Prickle (Zaraday), Bureaucracy 5 YOLD 3166, 11:00pm
	- Initial release to CPAN

1.01  Setting Orange, Bureaucracy 6 YOLD 3166, 12:10am
	- Decided that returning an array made no sense at all.
	- Added leap year checking

1.02  Sweetmorn, Bureaucracy 7 YOLD 3166, 10:50pm
	- Matt added the Holyday handling
	- Made time the default argument
	- Additional documentation

1.03  Sweetmorn, Bureaucracy 7 YOLD 3166, 11:28pm
	- Updated documentation a little

1.04  Boomtime, Bureaucracy 48 YOLD 3166, 12:02am
     - Added inverse_discordian function

1.26  Pungenday, Confusion 57 YOLD 3167, 22:15:48
    - It seemed important to gice this a new, entirely meaningless
      version number. 1.26 Seems like a good one. Law of fives: 1 - 2
      + 6 = 5. 
    - Added much more thorough testing.
    - Moved to Date::Leapyear for the leapyear calculations. This
      increases the Eristic factor of this code, since its
      dependencies are now spread over more modules. Look out for
      Date::Calc in the next version.
    - I would put more quotes from the principia in the code and in
      the documentation, but (and I know this is a heresy) I don't
      have a copy with me, and I am temporarily unconnected from that
      source of all Chaos, the Internet.
    - But mostly, there's no good reason for this release, except that
      I'm trying to put off doing real work.
