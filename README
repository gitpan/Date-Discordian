NAME
    Date::Discordian - Calculate the Discordian date of a particular day

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Discordian;
      $discordian = discordian(time);
      $epochtime = inverse_discordian('bureaucracy 47, 3166');

    Or, the OO interface ...

      use Date::Discordian;
      my $disco = Date::Discordian->new( epoch => time );
      $discordian = $disco->discordian;

      my $date = Date::Discordian->new( 
        discordian => 'bureaucracy 47, 3166');
      $epoch = $date->epoch;
      $ical = $date->ical;
      $discordian = $date->discordian;

      $season = $date->season;
      $discoday = $date->discoday; # eg 'Pungenday'
      $yold = $date->yold;
      $holyday = $date->holyday;

    Or, for dates outside of the epoch:

      my $disco = Date::Discordian->new( ical => '17760704Z' );
      $discordian = $disco->discordian;

    Note that a Date::Discordian object ISA Date::ICal object, so see the
    docs for Date::ICal as well.

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the Discordian date of a particular 'real' date.

    Date::Discordian exports two functions - discordian(), and
    inverse_discordian. "discordian()", when given a time value, returns a
    string, giving the Discordian date for the given day.
    *inverse_discordian()*, given a Discordian date in the same format that
    "discordian()" emits, returns an epoch time value. It is pretty picky
    about time format. Pity.

    I'm really not sure how this would ever be used, so if you actually use
    this, send me a note.

Bugs/To Do
        There are no bugs. Only misinterpretation of the documentation.
        Accept C<ddate>-style input. And possibly output the same format as
            ddate, since that seems more widely accepted
        Perhaps an option of some variety to be able to create dates to use
            the 4000bc epoch rather than the 1166bc epoch
        Get mentioned in more articles about the cool things you can do with
            Perl (http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/10/31/lighter.html)

General comments
    When I first started working on this module, it was purely as an
    exercise to get started on Date:: modules in general. Since that time, I
    have become alarmingly aware of how the events of real life seem to
    follow the Discordian calendrical rhythm. Perhaps this is just because
    everything sucks all of the time, but it seems to be a little deeper
    than this.

    You can find out more about the Discordian Calendar at
    http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/discordian_calendar.html and at
    a plethora of other sites on the Internet.

    It is related to the Principia Discordia
    (http://members.xoom.com/ffungo/titlepage.html) and the "religion" of
    Discordianism. I suppose that there are people that actually take this
    sort of thing seriously. But then, there are people that collect Beanie
    Babies, so what do you expect?
