NAME
    Date::Discordian - Calculate the Discordian date of a particular day

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Discordian;
      $discordian = discordian(time);
      $epochtime = inverse_discordian('bureaucracy 47, 3166');

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the Discordian date of a particular 'real' date.

    Date::Discordian exports just one function - discordian() - which, when
    given a time value, returns a string, giving the Discordian date for the
    given day.

    I'm really not sure how this would ever be used, so if you actually use
    this, send me a note.

Bugs/To Do
            a timestamp-ish form of Discordian (similar to Julian)
            conversion back from Discordian to epoch
            more chicken references.

General comments
    You can find out more about the Discordian Calendar at
    http://www.concentric.net/~darkfox/DiscoCal.html and at a plethora of
    other sites on the Internet.

    It is related to the Principia Discordia
    (http://members.xoom.com/ffungo/titlepage.html) and the "religion" of
    Discordianism. I suppose that there are people that actually take this
    sort of thing seriously. But then, there are people that collect Beanie
    Babies, so what do you expect?
