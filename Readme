NAME
    Date::Discordian - Calculate the Discordian date of a particular day

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Discordian;
      $discordian = discordian(time);
      $epochtime = inverse_discordian('bureaucracy 47, 3166');

    Or, the OO interface ...

      use Date::Discordian;
      my $disco = Date::Discordian->new( epoch => time );
      $discordian = $disco->discordian;

      my $date = Date::Discordian->new( 
        discordian => 'bureaucracy 47, 3166');
      $epoch = $date->epoch;
      $ical = $date->ical;
      $discordian = $date->discordian;

    Note that a Date::Discordian object ISA Date::ICal object, so see the
    docs for Date::ICal as well.

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the Discordian date of a particular 'real' date.

    Date::Discordian exports two functions - discordian(), and
    inverse_discordian. "discordian()", when given a time value, returns a
    string, giving the Discordian date for the given day.
    *inverse_discordian()*, given a Discordian date in the same format that
    "discordian()" emits, returns an epoch time value. It is pretty picky
    about time format. Pity.

    I'm really not sure how this would ever be used, so if you actually use
    this, send me a note.

Bugs/To Do

General comments
    You can find out more about the Discordian Calendar at
    http://www.concentric.net/~darkfox/DiscoCal.html and at a plethora of
    other sites on the Internet.

    It is related to the Principia Discordia
    (http://members.xoom.com/ffungo/titlepage.html) and the "religion" of
    Discordianism. I suppose that there are people that actually take this
    sort of thing seriously. But then, there are people that collect Beanie
    Babies, so what do you expect?
